## Game of Blackjack


### Overview:

For the first project I chose to create a simple Blackjack game. I felt that this was a good combination of JavaScript logic and CSS styling to exercise my skills.

Once the page is loaded the user is asked if they would like to play the game. If they answer yes then the user is asked to place a bet. After the bet is placed the user has the opportunity to hit or stay. Once stay is chosen the program does a series of checks and makes the dealer decision. The dealer decision is based on the dealer score vs the player score. In the end a winner is determined using standard Blackjack rules.
